\section{The end of the beginning}

\begin{frame}{To conclude}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Again, optimization is an art! My goal was actually twofold:\begin{enumerate}
			\item Convince you that compiler knows better than you, and
			\item Convince you that the directive approach allows you to gradually improve performance without (much) of rewrite.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item There is a clear trend towards GPUs, so the support will improve in the future (and a standard will probably emerge\footnote{It may already be there, with all libraries copying the CUDA style.}). You just need to avoid data transfer as much as possible.
		\item This was just an introduction, so take a look around! The CÃ‰CI is organizing training if you are interested to go further (\url{http://www.ceci-hpc.be/training.html}), and there is a student cluster at UNamur (called Hyades) if you want to play (in the frame of a lecture, though).
		\item If you really want to explore the topic, keep in mind that other languages also have concurrent tasks directly available as part of the language...
